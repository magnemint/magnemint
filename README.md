```python

class Magnemint:
    def __init__():        
        age = 69
        nationality = "Micheal Jordean"
        languages = ["Get", "On", "My", "House", "It is very cool"]

        programing_languages = ["Python", "Java"]

        website = "magnemint.github.io"
        discord = {
            "username": "Magnemint#5880",
            "server": "discord.gg/K2K7V4wCj6"
        }
        
```

p.s. I took this from someone else because they took someone else's code L
